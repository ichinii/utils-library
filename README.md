the setup will overwrite your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile !! be aware of that
it will create a ~/bin folder
to setup, run './setup_linux' or './setup_mac' when in repository, and restart terminal

mkdir $tmpdir
chown 'your account name' $tmpdir
chmod +w $tmpdir

then you should be able to use all applications
